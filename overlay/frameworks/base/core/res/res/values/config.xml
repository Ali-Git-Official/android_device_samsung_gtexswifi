         There are many prerequisites for this feature to work correctly.
         Here are a few of them:
         * The WiFi radio must support WiFi P2P.
         * The WiFi radio must support concurrent connections to the WiFi display and
         to an access point.
         * The Audio Flinger audio_policy.conf file must specify a rule for the "r_submix"
         remote submix module.  This module is used to record and stream system
         audio output to the WiFi display encoder in the media server.
         * The remote submix module "audio.r_submix.default" must be installed on the device.
         * The device must be provisioned with HDCP keys (for protected content).

         which can't send and receive sms message.
